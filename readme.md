 **Laravel 5.3.19 app boilerplate with email verification on registration**

Every time I or my colleagues start a laravel project , we need to re-implement this process of adding email verification in the project every time , so created this boilerplate out of personal needs 

How I achieved this can be read [here at my blog](http://www.lubus.in/blog/adding-email-verification-in-laravel-5-3-app-149)

 - Download and run `composer install`
 - After installation , configure the .env file (App key, Database credentials, Mail driver)
 - Run `php artisan migrate`
 - That's it , you are done!

I advise you to read the blog mentioned above to understand what's going on here exactly. If you have any questions or suggestions , drop a comment on the blog or create an issue here , would be happy to help , or just come say hi :-) 

> Will keep it updated with the latest stable laravel version
